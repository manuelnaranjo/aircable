In this page you will find all our open source projects.

We have made a series of tutorials to show our clients how to use our products. This tutorials include things like: Slave and Master handling, Interactive code, Networking, and Hardware interfacing. In each section you will find some examples that will show you how to achieve different tasks. [Check our tutorials](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/Tutorial_Index)

Here is a subset of examples that we think are very interesting to see:
[Wireless Command Line](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/CommandLineOverSPP) **[Relay Mode Code](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/Relay)**
[GPS and Data Logging](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/GPS_Data_Logging) **[vCard Sender](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/vCard)**
[SMS Sender](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/smsSender)

We had made a set of tools to work with AIRcable BASIC code with the excellent [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org) editor. You can read about the tools [here](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/jEdit_Tools) and you can even watch a video that shows you how the tools work.

There is also a tool set made in Java without a Graphical Interface, you can check here for a brief description: [link](http://code.google.com/p/aircable/wiki/BASIC_Tool).
